Hello, I am Pedro Botelho.

I made this program for a course second and final test, Computer Architecture and Organization I. The entire program is in English, and the report is available in English and Portuguese. 

You can compile the program by going to the root folder and typing in your terminal "make build" (if you have Makefile installed). The programm is already in the Linux "shape", so to run it in your distro just type "./bin/lampCounter" in the root folder.

Details of how the program works, as well as implementation details are available at doc/lampCounter_en.pdf and doc/lampCounter_pt.pdf. 

If you are confused in the organization of the folders, go to the README.md in the repository root.
