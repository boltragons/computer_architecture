Assembly language codes (*.asm), as well as documents of my own on the subject of "Computer Architecture and
Organization".

My name is Pedro Botelho, and I do Computer Engineering at the Federal University of Ceará, campus in Quixadá, here in Brazil. All of my codes can be found in English, being a virtually universal language (Esperanto is not a thing).  All done based on the knowledge earned in the "Computer Architecture and Organization" courses of the Computer
Engineering course at the Federal University of Ceará.
